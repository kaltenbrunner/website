I'm a Swedish clarinetist and programmer with a love for Mozart's music and
functional programming.

Currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at [Chalmers University
of Technology](https://chalmers.se).

Additionally, I enjoy doing some freelance gigs as a clarinetist.

Currently writing articles for [Slow Your Mind](https://slowyourmind.com).
