I started to play the clarinet at age ten. Since then, I have played in several
ensembles in Sweden, including *Landslaget i blåsmusik* (Swedish National Youth
Symphonic Band) in 2015 and *Västra Götalands ungdomssymfoniker* (Youth
Orchestra of Västra Götaland) in 2016-2017 and 2019-2020.

I often perform as a soloist and have performed in many venues in my home town
Göteborg. My [repertoire](/repertoire) contains many standard works for
clarinet, but I also enjoy performing contemporary music.

In 2019, I was a finalist in the Danish-Swedish music competition Øresunds
Solist, where I performed *Solo de Concours* by french composer Henri Rabaud. 
In the same year, I also took up the E-flat clarinet, which has given me
numerous opportunities to explore new repertoire and play with new people.

I'm in my third year of studies towards a bachelor's degree in Computer
Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. I have programming
experiences in Haskell (my favourite language), Java, C, Assembly and Python.
Some of my projects are available on my GitHub page.

I've also been working as a teacher assistant in courses in object oriented
programming, machine oriented programming and computer engineering.

When I’m home I enjoy practicing yoga, strength training, running and spending
time in nature.

Also working on my new project [Slow Your Mind](https://slowyourmind.com).
